# liquidctl-config
systemctl service files for controlling equipment with RGB headers
works for only my settings, don't recommend using aside from for a template

the liquidcfg.service file is for enabling liquidctl at boot with my settings
the liquidcfg-suspend.service file is for resuming my liquidctl settings from hybernation
