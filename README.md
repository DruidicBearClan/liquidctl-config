# liquidctl-config
systemd service files for controlling hardware with RGB headers.
The settings work for only my setup, don't recommend using those, you can use the template.

The liquidcfg.service file is for enabling liquidctl at boot with my desired settings.
The liquidcfg-suspend.service file is for resuming liquidctl with those settings from suspend/sleep mode.
